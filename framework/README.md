The Menu contains Four submenus - File, DataPlugin, VisualPlugin, and DataCategory.

1) We must explicitly choose which plugins to run through the framework to see the visualizataion.
Lets choose a DataPlugin first:
2) Some Data Plugins need some user inputs. The GUI will request those inputs on behalf on the Plugin when you select them.
3) Some Data Plugins need a lot of time to initialize. The GUI may become unresponsive for a couple seconds after the selection.
4) The DataCategory menu will be enabled after you select a DataPlugin. The DataCategory menu will enable you to choose which
    two data categories you want to select as the Node and the Link. You cannot select one category for both the Link and Node. However
    you can choose any two arbitrary categories as a Node and a Link. 
    
5) Choose a VisualPlugin to render the data from the DataPlugin with. 
6) Select "Apply Plugin" on the File Menu. You will then be able to visualize the data.
